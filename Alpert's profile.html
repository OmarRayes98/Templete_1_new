                <p><b>Albert Einstein</b> (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[6] German: 
                    [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (audio speaker iconlisten);
                     14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity,
                     but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</p>
                <p>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'),
                     Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[14] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity.
                     He then extended the theory to gravitational fields;</p>
                <p>published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation.
                     In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[15][16] He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, 
                    which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light</p>
                <p>In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. 
                    Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government;[18] he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.[19] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. 
                    Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.</p>
